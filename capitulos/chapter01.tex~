\subsection{Environmental co-variates}

Two sets of ground control points (GCPs) were used to validate the data layers: $n=14$ GCPs located in easily identifiable geographic markers and $n=60$ GCPs located along twelve transects obtained through probabilistic sampling.

After validation and correction of the data layers, a suite of 34 environmental co-variates was derived (Table __).
